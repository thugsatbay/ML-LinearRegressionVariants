ML555_GurleenSinghDhodyAss2.pdf contains the solution/answers to assignment 2

Rest of are the code files.
Modified files:
-dataloader.py
-regressionalgorithms.py
-script_regression.py

*You can also change the max iterations for each algorithms that follow iterative approach so that if the tolerance condition is not met the code can exit gracefully. This can be done by updating the dictionary regressionalgs in script_regression.py for each algo.
